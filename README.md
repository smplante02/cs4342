# cs4342
Assignments for CS4342 (Machine Learning) with Jacob Whitehill. Learned about various machine learning models including nearest-neighbor, 3-layer neural networks, and deep learning.

For my contribution to the final project, I created a 3-layer neural network using Keras (through Tensorflow).
